To add a new fractal type follow the following simple steps:

- Create a new subdir under fractal/, i.e. fractal/newfractal/
- Copying fractal/example/example.go fractal/newfractal/newfractal.go
- Search and replace example with newfractal, implement your fractal's formula
in ComputeMembership
- In fracserv/fracserv.go:
  - Add an import for your new fractal type
  - Add an extry in the factory map setup in init()
- Add an html fragment in fracserv/templates/ for the form that allows you to
set any parameters for your fractal, see fracserv/templates/example.html

You should be able to run standalone/ and see your new fractal type as a
choice in the top bar, congrats!
